Phase 1: Foundation Setup

Task 1: Define Your State Machine

    Identify all possible states for your tokenizer:
        Normal state (looking for next token)
        Word state (collecting alphanumeric characters)
        Single quote state (collecting characters inside single quotes)
        Double quote state (collecting characters inside double quotes)
        Operator state (collecting operator characters)

    For each state, define what input causes transitions to other states.

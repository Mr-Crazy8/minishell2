Rules:
    - Unquoted variables are expanded directly
    - $? is replaced with the exit status of the last command
    - Double quotes allow expansion
    - Single quotes prevent expansion
    - Double quotes allow expansion but preserve spaces
    - Single quotes preserve everything literally
    - Adjacent variables are concatenated
    - Braces help define variable name boundaries
    - Word splitting occurs on unquoted expansions
    - Variables expand in redirection filenames
    - Quote context affects expansion within the token
    - if we have Double quotes and in side we have Single quotes it will expan inside the Single quotes
    - if we have Single quotes and in side we have Double quotes it will not expan inside the Double quotes
    - if we have Variables next to each other we will join the value of theme 
    - if we have Variables next to text it will print empty or a newline
    - if we have Variables in this mode {} next to text it will print the value joined with the text
